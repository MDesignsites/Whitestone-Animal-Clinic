                        <li>Usually, veterinary clinics do not process the payment itself from the insurance company.

                            responsibility to coordinate with the insurance company based on their policy.</li>
                        <li>For your patients with insurance policies, we do assist them by issuing a thorough and

                    <p>"This is the most decent veterinary clinic for me within Binan area. The clinic is clean, staffs
                        are pleasant, and the doctors are considerate. The cost of diagnostic test is reasonable. Though
                        the medicines are a bit overpriced, which is common among vet clinics.

                    <p>
                        One of my cats has ocular FIP and needed to be treated with the anti-viral injection GS-441524
                        on a daily basis for 84 days. Doc Carlo was very considerate to give me a discount on the
                        GS-441524 and waive the daily consultation. I am eternally grateful for this clinic and will
                        highly recommend it."

                <p>The Netherland Dwarf, Mini Rex, and the Britannia Petite are only three of fifty fancy
                    rabbit breeds in Sugar and Spice Rabbitry. While enthusiasts are the usual market for these
                    rabbits, they still make great pets – large breeds are most popular in both cases. Since they are
                    mostly from the US and Europe, they call for attentive handling and delicate maintenance.
                    Ocular health should be closely monitored during routine exams, as eye discharge and
                    cloudiness are frequent concerns. Unlike our canine and feline friends, rabbits lack paw pads,
                    increasing their risk of pododermatitis. However, just like any animal companion, knowing a
                    rabbit’s unique rhythm and behavior should be understood first before owning one.</p>

                <p>Bonswan Kennel houses over 31 dog breeds, including extra large breeds like the Cane
                    Corso and the Bernese Mountain Dog. Even with the large variety of dogs, with different
                    requirements and sensitivities, the kennel ensures that their dogs receive optimal care. Their
                    goal in health care centers on minimizing pharmaceutical intervention hence the stress on
                    proper diet, updated vaccination, regular deworming, and other supplemental care. Having dogs
                    as your companion requires you to know how important these are, their temperament and
                    wellness solely depends on you. Before welcoming a dog into your life, remember to base your
                    choice on your lifestyle, the time you can give, and the resources required, especially as it
                    grows larger as your dog does.</p>

                <p>Pet ownership has seen its surge during the pandemic, and this may steadily rise as
                    more people prefer this kind of companionship. However, owning pets is not done on a whim –
                    it’s a planned out decision, designed for a lifelong responsibility. There is a wide array of
                    domestic animals for you to choose from, may it be furry, feathered, or even scaled. <br><br>
                    Cats and dogs are the most common, from there, there are plenty of breeds to choose
                    from. Bonswan Kennel offers 31 breeds of dogs ranging from small breeds like Pugs and
                    Pekingese to large breeds like the Cane Corso and the Great Dane. The kennel offers top-notch
