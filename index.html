                <p>The Netherland Dwarf, Mini Rex, and the Britannia Petite are only three of fifty fancy
                    rabbit breeds in Sugar and Spice Rabbitry. While enthusiasts are the usual market for these
                    rabbits, they still make great pets – large breeds are most popular in both cases. Since they are
                    mostly from the US and Europe, they call for attentive handling and delicate maintenance.
                    Ocular health should be closely monitored during routine exams, as eye discharge and
                    cloudiness are frequent concerns. Unlike our canine and feline friends, rabbits lack paw pads,
                    increasing their risk of pododermatitis. However, just like any animal companion, knowing a
                    rabbit’s unique rhythm and behavior should be understood first before owning one.</p>

                    member of any household. These graceful and sweet rabbits will grow close to you as long as

                    but any animal can, if they’re raised in a nurturing environment.</p>

                <p>Guinea pigs, or cavies can live as long as 15 years – that, with their holistic health
                    achieved. Cavies are easy to take care of and above that, they’re also affectionate and smart,
                    they can follow a routine. However, don’t mistake their simplicity for independence, they don’t
                    deserve to be overlooked.</p>

                <p>Bonswan Kennel houses over 31 dog breeds, including extra large breeds like the Cane
                    Corso and the Bernese Mountain Dog. Even with the large variety of dogs, with different
                    requirements and sensitivities, the kennel ensures that their dogs receive optimal care. Their
                    goal in health care centers on minimizing pharmaceutical intervention hence the stress on
                    proper diet, updated vaccination, regular deworming, and other supplemental care. Having dogs
                    as your companion requires you to know how important these are, their temperament and
                    wellness solely depends on you. Before welcoming a dog into your life, remember to base your
                    choice on your lifestyle, the time you can give, and the resources required, especially as it
                    grows larger as your dog does.</p>

                <p>Truly, Urban Wildcats showcase sophistication in their award-winning exotic cats.
                    Bengals and Toygers are among the breeds raised in this cattery, built for shows both
                    international and abroad. Since these cats tour around the globe, they need a robust immune
                    system anchored on their food intake. Beyond their wellness routine, their diet fuels their
                    function and vitality. For first time enthusiasts, a shorthair cat from a reputable breeder is a
                    great
                    choice!</p>

                <p>Pet ownership has seen its surge during the pandemic, and this may steadily rise as
                    more people prefer this kind of companionship. However, owning pets is not done on a whim –
                    it’s a planned out decision, designed for a lifelong responsibility. There is a wide array of
                    domestic animals for you to choose from, may it be furry, feathered, or even scaled. <br><br>
                    Cats and dogs are the most common, from there, there are plenty of breeds to choose
                    from. Bonswan Kennel offers 31 breeds of dogs ranging from small breeds like Pugs and
                    Pekingese to large breeds like the Cane Corso and the Great Dane. The kennel offers top-notch
                    facilities from breeding and whelping to every phase of a dog’s life. You can be assured that the
                    dogs are well cared for. Urban Wildcats, on the other hand, features award-winning cats, like

                    2024. Somalis, Abyssinians, and Bengals are among the 30 breeds raised in the cattery. If
                    you’re looking for more gentle animals, maybe rabbits or cavies are good for you. Sugar and
                    Spice Rabbitry has 50 breeds to choose from, of over 700 fancy rabbits. <br><br>

                    goal is holistic growth. Whitestone Animal Clinic serves as the veterinary provider for these
